> Want to here music sitting together in a group but no one is<br />carrying a bluetooth speaker?
A single device sounds awful<br />when turning up the volume...

>**The solution is MusicShare.**
With MusicShare you can listen<br />to music stored on your device **synchronous** on several devices.

### How about the volume?
If you turn down the volume on all connected devices single devices will be a bit quieter but in addition all devices are louder.

### How does this work?
MusicShare uses Googles **Nearby API** to connect to other devices and send audio files. These files will then be played synchronously on all devices.
